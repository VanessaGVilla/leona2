<p> As the most prominent female figure during Mexico’s War for Independence waged from 1810-1821, <b> Leona Vicario</b>
  is called,<q> La Patria Madre de Mexico</q>. which translates to <q> Distinguished and Beloved Mother of the Homeland</q>.
</p>

<h2> Early Life </h2>
  <p> Leona Vicario was born April 10, 1789 in Mexico City to well-to-do parents.
Her father was a merchant from Spain and her mother was from an equally wealthy family from San Salvador; 
several sources state both her parents were Spanish. She was raised in a wealthy, exclusive, highly educated lifestyle
by her parents until she was 18, whereupon both died and left her in the care of her paternal uncle, who practiced law,
Agustin Fernandez de San Salvador Pompous. At 18 yers of age she had acquired an invaluable education, which she put to use by 
by filing for legal independence from her uncle, which allowed her to make all financial and legal decions in her own interest.</p>
<br>
<p> Leona had significant social standing in New Spain's (Mexico)racist caste system that 
was forcefully imposed on it by the Spanish. The 16th century Spaniards, along with their overlords in the Roman Catholic Church, 
were so obsessed with race that they produced posters commissioned by artists to describe the 16 official <q>racial mixtures</q> 
along with their legal statuses. Because of Leona's heritage, she was publicly acknowledged at the top of society heirarchy.
 It made her nearly untouchable when it came to capital crimes, along with a wealth of social privileges.</p>
  
  <br>
  <p> Leona's extensive education had given her a foundation to develop critical thinking skills, which encouraged 
   independence from the pervasive patriarchy of New Spain (Mexico). Her attention soon turned to revolutionary idealists, at 
   great personal risk. It also brought her to the attention of a succesful lawyer, Quintana Roo.
   The pair eventually married.</p>
  <br>
  <h3> Los Guadalupes-The Beginning of a Rebel Life </h3>
  <p> Leona joined Los Guadalupes, a secret rebel society receiving and distributing correspondence for the independence
   of New Spain from the Spanish Crown. Leona expanded her involvement by using her banking connections to secretly finance 
   various stages of the rebellion.She furthered her commitment by directly buying arms and 
   acquiring materials to make cannons and artillery. Leona also arranged the purchase and shipment of medicines to Vera Cruz. 
   She secretly transported them to neighborhoodsin Mexico City where she also hid revolutionary compatriots. 
   <br>
   Not content as a rebel and arms dealer, Leona then teamed with Quintana Roo to perfect her journalistic prose and write political articles. 
   He provided his family's printing presses to produce their liberal political ideas for the masses. Leona's revolutionary networks
   then distributed those leaflets, informing the public of Spanish atrocities towards Native and Mestizo civilians, crimes associated 
with the established social caste system, and the need to obtain independence of Spain.</p>
   with the established social caste system, and the need to obtain self-rule independent of Spain.</P>
 

  <p>1813, Leona’s correspondence to Andres and her revolutionary network was intercepted by Spanish Royalists.
    She was arrested fleeing Mexico City. Because of her social class status, the Court of Inquisition was limited 
    in it's right to punish her brutally while interrogating her about the location of her revolutionary collaborators.
    The court confiscated all her real properties and other bank assets, convinced a life without wealth and privilege would soon enough reveal all the information they were seeking.</p>

     When that didn’t happen, the Court of Inquisition sentenced her to a convent prison at <em>Belen de Las Mochas.</em> </p>

     <h3>Fight for Freedom</h3>
<p>Leona was imprisoned for several months, when three colonial officers arrived unannounced. They demanded access to Leona,
  claiming the need for another interrogation. The officers revealed themselves as rebel patriots, assisting Leona escape
  by disguising her as a servent. She returned to Mexico City, reunited with her husband, where they both continued their revolutionary
  activities.  Four years later, Leona and Andres were both arrested, but they were immediately granted amnesty from the Spanish
   Royalists. In 1823, the newly-formed Mexican Congress rewarded Leona Vicario for her numerous sacrifices on behalf of the nation
  of Mexico.
  Leona was given an estate, several houses in Mexico City, and a cash settlement for the total loss of her fortune in the service of
   her country. Leona passed away in 1842. She received a Mexican State funeral, and her remains, which have been re-interred several
  times, are at the National Palace placed in the National Gallery.

<blockquote><q>What separates privilege from entitlement is gratitude.</q></blockquote>

<p>Leona Vicario was born into a life of privilege, near the top of a social caste system that degraded Natives and those of
  mixed heritage. She chose to live as a fearless woman, intent on helping change the oppressive system based on colonization
  and patriarchal dominance.
